In order for native-deps to do the right thing you need to make sure to package your jar properly. Create a folder called *native* for the native libraries. Also create folder *lib* for any normal jars that your dependency uses. For example the LWJGL 2.2.2 library was packaged for Leiningen like so:

<pre>
/lib
/lib/*.jar

/native/
/native/macosx/x86/*.dynlib
/native/macosx/x86_64/*.dynlib
/native/windows/x86/*.dll
/native/windows/x86_64/*.dll
/native/linux/x86/*.so
/native/linux/x86_64/*.so
/native/solaris/x86/*.so
/native/solaris/x86_64/*.so
</pre>

The naming convention is important.

<pre>
Platforms:
---------------------
Mac OS X -> macosx
Windows  -> windows
Linux    -> linux
SunOS"   -> solaris

Architectures
--------------------
amd64    -> x86_64
x86_64   -> x86_64
x86      -> x86
i386     -> x86
arm      -> arm
sparc    -> sparc
</pre>

You should then create your jar with the following command:

<pre class="console">
jar -cMf foo.jar native lib
</pre>

Your jar is ready to push to Clojars. You can read more about that process "here":http://wiki.github.com/ato/clojars-web/tutorial
